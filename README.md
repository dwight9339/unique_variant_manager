# Yubi

Yubi provides tools to help Shopify merchants sell versions of products that are only slightly altered versions of a base product. This allows merchants who make handmade goods to offer items that are unique but that don't warrant the hassle of creating separate product pages for each one and all of the extra copywriting and SEO work that this would entail. The Yubi app provides a solution for such merchants by providing a way to easily create variants for a base product that don't conform to the standard "option-based" method of variant creation used by Shopify by instead allowing each individual variant to be given its own name and description describing its unique qualities. Bundled with the app is a theme app block that can be used on the product page to show a grid of thumbnails for each variant instead of an options list.
